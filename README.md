# TestMyPassword

TestMyPassword is a Python-based password strength tester and password improvement suggestion tool.

The tool also offers recommendations for creating stronger passwords when the user enters a weak or moderate password.

## Features

- Password Strength Test: TestMyPassword uses regular expressions to check if the entered password meets specific criteria for a strong password.
- Password Improvement Suggestions: If the entered password is weak or moderate, TestMyPassword provides suggestions for improving the password strength by adding missing elements like uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters.
- Simple Command Line Interface: The tool has a straightforward command-line interface, making it easy to use for users.
